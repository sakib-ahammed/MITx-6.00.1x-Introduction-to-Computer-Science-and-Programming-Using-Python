PROBLEM 3-2  (2 points possible)
The following Python code is supposed to compute the square of an integer by using succesive additions.

def Square(x):
    return SquareHelper(abs(x), abs(x))

def SquareHelper(n, x):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return SquareHelper(n-1, x) + x
What is the wrong with this implementation of procedure Square? Check all that apply.


The term Square is a reserved Python keyword. , Function names cannot start with a capital letter. , This function will not work for negative numbers. , The call SquareHelper(abs(x), abs(x)) won't work because you can't have abs(x) as both parameters. , - incorrect It is going to return a wrong value. The term Square is a reserved Python keyword. Function names cannot start with a capital letter. The function is never going to return anything. Python has arbitrary precision arithmetic. This function will not work for negative numbers. The call SquareHelper(abs(x), abs(x)) won't work because you can't have abs(x) as both parameters. Nothing is wrong; the code is fine as-is.
