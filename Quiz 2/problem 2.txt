PROBLEM 2-1  (1/1 point)
Examine the following code and answer the following question without running it.

x = [2,1]
y = [2,1]
z = False
if x == y:
    if sorted(x) == sorted(y):
         if x.sort() == y.sort():
               z =  x.sort() == sorted(y)
print z
The preceding Python statements will print False because

x is not equal to y sorted(x) is not equal to sorted(y) x.sort() is not equal to y.sort() x.sort() is not equal to sorted(y) <span><code>x.sort()</code> is not equal to <code>sorted(y)</code></span> - correct
