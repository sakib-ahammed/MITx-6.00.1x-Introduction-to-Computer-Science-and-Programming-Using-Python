Answer the questions below based on the following sorting function. If it helps, you may paste the code in your programming environment. Study the output to make sure you understand the way it sorts.

      
def swapSort(L): 
    """ L is a list on integers """
    print "Original L: ", L
    for i in range(len(L)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(L)):
            if L[j] < L[i]:
                # the next line is a short 
                # form for swap L[i] and L[j]
                L[j], L[i] = L[i], L[j] 
                print L
    print "Final L: ", L
      
    
Does this function sort the list in increasing or decreasing order? (items at lower indices being smaller means it sorts in increasing order, and vice versa)


Increasing <span> <text> Increasing</text> </span> - correct Decreasing

PROBLEM 6-2  (1/1 point)
What is the worst case time complexity of swapSort? Consider different kinds of lists when the length of the list is large.


O(n2) <span> <text> O(n2)</text> </span> - correct O(n) O(log(n)) O(1)

If we make a small change to the line for j in range(i+1, len(L)): such that the code becomes:

      
def modSwapSort(L): 
    """ L is a list on integers """
    print "Original L: ", L
    for i in range(len(L)):
        for j in range(len(L)):
            if L[j] < L[i]:
                # the next line is a short 
                # form for swap L[i] and L[j]
                L[j], L[i] = L[i], L[j] 
                print L
    print "Final L: ", L
      
    
What happens to the behavior of swapSort with this new code?


No change modSwapSort now orders the list in descending order for all lists. <span> <text><code>modSwapSort</code> now orders the list in descending order for all lists.</text> </span> - correct modSwapSort now orders the list in descending order for SOME lists but not all modSwapSort enters an infinite loop.

What happens to the time complexity of this modSwapSort?


Best and worst cases stay the same. Worst case stays the same but best case changes. <span> <text> Worst case stays the same but best case changes.</text> </span> - incorrect Best and worst cases change.
